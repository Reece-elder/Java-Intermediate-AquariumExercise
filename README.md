# Java-Intermediate-aQArium_exercise

Hey! 

Your task is to complete this Java project. 
To start you need to do one of the following: 

1) Fork this project and work off of the forked repo 
2) Create your own repo, clone this repo down and move the files from this repo to your new repo 
3) Copy and paste the source code into your own repo

Once you've got this data on your own repo or account you need to check through the code and see what needs finishing.

By the end of this exercise day you should have done the following:

- Create a Controller class pls
- Set up a MySQL database using the supplied SQL queries
- Set up a test database
- Completed the TODO methods in AquariumManager
- Completed the testing in AquariumManagerTest (Still aiming for 80% coverage if possible!)

Stretch goals to consider: 

- Using a scanner to allow the user to enter their own data
- Incorporating more tables and objects, maybe some lizards? Or fish supplies like tanks, and food?
- Adding more methods to the manager classes

Overall this is quite a lot of work so don't expect to finish it all, but if you have any questions make sure to ask :)
